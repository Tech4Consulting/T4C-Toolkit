# OData

When querying Unit4 ERP object APIs OData V2 is supported ([Documentation](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/uri-conventions/)).

OData can be used to restrict the returned object data.  These samples provide various examples of how to use filters and selects to extract specific data.

OData lookups are also supported by the latest version of Unit4 Report Engine in Unit4 ERP7 when querying objects and specifically in Unit4 ERPx where this is the only way to return data.

Examples are shown using the Swagger API documentation area found at {Your ERP Public API URI}/swagger
