# T4C Toolkit
The T4C toolkit provides a repository of examples, how-to guides and fully functional samples of Unit4 Extension Kit flows.

Because creation of Extension Kit flows often requires interaction with the Unit4 People Platform you will also find examples of REST API queries specific to the Unit4 Public APIs, including examples of ODATA lookups for objects.

The Unit4 Extension Kit is available to Unit4 ERPx customers along with Unit4 ERP7 managed cloud customers.  Public REST APIs are vailable to these customers as well but can also be used by Unit4 ERP7 on premise customers.

## Technical Training
Tech4 Consulting provides a range of technical training available from [https://tech4.learnworlds.com](https://tech4.learnworlds.com) 

If you want to learn more about using the technical tools available with Unit4 ERPx and Unit4 ERP7, including Extension Kit, ACT and Report Engine, check out our range of courses.
